# Quick Start Guide: Creating Your First Agent

## Step 1: Check for Existing Agents (5 minutes)

1. Ask yourself: "What do I want this agent to do?"
2. Open the Agent Catalog in SharePoint
3. Search for keywords related to your use case
4. Review the top 3-5 matches
5. If a similar agent exists, consider extending it instead of creating new

## Step 2: Talk to the Orchestrator Agent (10 minutes)

Once built, the Orchestrator Agent will help you determine if you need a new agent. For now:

1. Document your use case in 2-3 sentences
2. List the data sources you'll need
3. Identify your target users
4. Note any similar agents you found

   - Requestor: [Your name]
   - Start Date: [Today]
4. In Notes field, paste your use case and findings from Step 1

## Step 4: Requirements Gathering (30-60 minutes)
